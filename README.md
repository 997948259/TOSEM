# PPTLCheck+

PPTLCheck+ is a distributed network-based runtime verification tool. 

The input of PPTLCheck+ is the monitored Xd-C program and the desired property specified by a PPTL formula. 

PPTLCheck+ consists of three modules: a translator used to convert an Xd-C program into an MSVL program, a compiler employed to compile an MSVL program into executable code, and a verifier to complete the verification task, which is contained in the folder "/tools".

# Function of each folder
