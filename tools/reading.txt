The filefolder DNRV-MMRV stores the tools DNRV and MMRV, 
The filefolder distributedMachines stores the modules implemented in distributed machines in MMRV. 
In the runtime verification project (no matter DNRV and MMRV), both of the monitored MSVL program and the desired property are written in the file "_MSVInput.m".
The setting information is written in the file DNRV-MMRV/MSV/Info.txt.
(1) In the first line, 0 means MMRV, 1 means DNRV. 
If DNRV is selected, the following lines should also be considered.
(2) The second line should be written as 1.
(3) The third line means the port number used to socket communication between M0 and M1-Mn.
(4) The fourth line means the number of distributed machines.
(5) The fifth line means the number of states in each segment.
(6) From the sixth line,  the IP addresses of distributed machines should be written.
